**Subject: ğŸš€ Heads Up: Cypress Tests Need Our Expertise!**

Dear Team,

I hope you're all doing well. It seems some of our Cypress tests have decided to take an unscheduled detour. We need to bring them back on track to ensure the continued success of our project.

Here are the tests that need our attention:

- **Test 1:** [Brief description of the failed test]
- **Test 2:** [Brief description of the failed test]
- **Test 3:** [Brief description of the failed test]

Your prompt attention and expertise are essential in diagnosing and resolving these issues. Let's tackle these challenges head-on and steer our tests back in the right direction. If you have any insights or ideas, please don't hesitate to share them.

Thank you for your commitment and swift action on this matter.

Best regards,

[Your Name]
