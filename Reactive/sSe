Server-Sent Events (SSE): Overview

Server-Sent Events (SSE) is a standard technology used to push updates from a server to a client in real time using a single, persistent HTTP connection. It is unidirectional, meaning the server can send updates to the client, but not vice versa.

How SSE Works

1. The client (e.g., browser) opens a connection to the server via an endpoint.


2. The server streams events to the client in text/event-stream format.


3. The client listens for messages and processes them.

Advantages of SSE

1. Simple to Implement: Native browser support through the EventSource API (no external libraries required).


2. Lightweight Protocol: Lower overhead compared to WebSockets for unidirectional data transfer.


3. Automatic Reconnection: Built-in support for reconnection if the connection is interrupted.


4. Efficient for Real-Time Updates: Ideal for applications like notifications, live scores, or stock price updates.


5. Works over HTTP/HTTPS: Easily integrates with existing HTTP infrastructure.

Disadvantages of SSE

1. Unidirectional: Communication is only from the server to the client. For bidirectional communication, WebSockets are better.


2. Limited Browser Support: While most modern browsers support SSE, older browsers may not.


3. Scaling Challenges: Maintaining many long-lived connections can be resource-intensive for the server.


4. No Binary Data: SSE only supports text-based messages (no direct binary transmission).


5. Relies on HTTP/1.1: SSE does not fully utilize the multiplexing benefits of HTTP/2.

Best Use Cases

Live notifications (e.g., social media updates).

Monitoring dashboards (e.g., server or system logs).

Real-time data feeds (e.g., stock prices, news updates).

SSE is an excellent choice for scenarios requiring lightweight, real-time, server-to-client updates without the need for bidirectional communication.
