Managing errors in an SSE (Server-Sent Events) architecture is essential to ensure smooth operation and a robust user experience. Hereâ€™s how you can handle errors effectively on the API side, step by step:


---

1. Detecting Errors on the Server

Types of Errors

Connection Issues: Client disconnects or network interruptions.

Internal Errors: Issues like database failures or exceptions in the backend logic.

Timeouts: Long inactivity from the client or server.


To manage these, you should:

Detect errors during data streaming.

Implement retries or fallback mechanisms.

Log errors for debugging.


Spring WebFlux Error Handling

In the SSE API, wrap your logic in a try-catch block or use a reactive operator to capture errors.

@GetMapping(value = "/notifications", produces = MediaType.TEXT_EVENT_STREAM_VALUE)
public Flux<String> streamNotifications() {
    return notificationService.getNotifications()
        .onErrorResume(throwable -> {
            log.error("Error streaming notifications", throwable);
            return Flux.just("Error occurred: " + throwable.getMessage());
        })
        .doOnCancel(() -> log.info("Client disconnected from notifications stream"));
}


---

2. Graceful Disconnection Handling

SSE streams remain open as long as the client is connected. Handle client disconnections to avoid resource leaks:

Use doOnCancel or doFinally to clean up resources when a client disconnects.


@GetMapping(value = "/notifications", produces = MediaType.TEXT_EVENT_STREAM_VALUE)
public Flux<String> streamNotifications() {
    return notificationService.getNotifications()
        .doOnCancel(() -> log.info("Client disconnected"))
        .doFinally(signalType -> log.info("Stream closed: " + signalType));
}


---

3. Sending Error Responses to the Client

When the server encounters a problem, you can notify the client by sending a specific SSE message indicating an error:

.onErrorResume(throwable -> Flux.just("event: error\ndata: Server error occurred\n\n"));

The message format:

event: Optional, specifies the type of message.

data: Contains the error message or details.


Example response:

event: error
data: Server error occurred


---

4. Retrying on Errors

SSE has a built-in retry mechanism. By default, browsers retry after 3 seconds when a connection drops. You can customize this on the server by including a retry directive in the SSE response:

return Flux.concat(
    Flux.just("retry: 5000\n\n"), // Instructs the client to retry after 5 seconds
    notificationService.getNotifications()
);


---

5. Handling Database Errors

If your SSE stream is tied to a database (e.g., listening for PostgreSQL notifications), handle errors like database unavailability gracefully:

Example with Error Logging and Default Fallback:

public Flux<String> getNotifications() {
    return Flux.create(sink -> {
        try {
            databaseConnection.listen("value_change_channel")
                .subscribe(notification -> sink.next(notification.getParameter()));
        } catch (Exception e) {
            log.error("Database error", e);
            sink.error(new RuntimeException("Database connection failed"));
        }
    }).onErrorResume(e -> Flux.just("Fallback: Could not fetch notifications"));
}


---

6. Logging and Monitoring

Implement robust logging for:

Connection lifecycle (doOnSubscribe, doOnCancel).

Errors (onErrorResume, onErrorContinue).

Client reconnections.


Example with SLF4J logging:

.doOnSubscribe(subscription -> log.info("Client connected to notifications stream"))
.doOnCancel(() -> log.info("Client disconnected"))
.onErrorResume(error -> {
    log.error("Error in SSE stream", error);
    return Flux.just("An error occurred: " + error.getMessage());
});

Use monitoring tools like:

Prometheus + Grafana: Track SSE connection metrics.

Distributed Tracing (e.g., Zipkin): Monitor API call performance and errors.



---

7. Front-End Error Handling

On the client (Angular) side, handle SSE disconnections gracefully and attempt reconnections when errors occur.

Angular Example:

import { Injectable } from '@angular/core';

@Injectable({
  providedIn: 'root'
})
export class NotificationService {
  private eventSource: EventSource;

  connect(): void {
    this.eventSource = new EventSource('http://localhost:8080/notifications');

    this.eventSource.onmessage = (event) => {
      console.log('Notification received:', event.data);
    };

    this.eventSource.onerror = (error) => {
      console.error('SSE connection error:', error);
      this.reconnect(); // Retry logic
    };
  }

  private reconnect(): void {
    console.log('Attempting to reconnect...');
    setTimeout(() => this.connect(), 5000); // Retry after 5 seconds
  }

  disconnect(): void {
    if (this.eventSource) {
      this.eventSource.close();
    }
  }
}

Summary of Error Management

On the API Side:

1. Catch and Log Errors:

Use onErrorResume or onErrorContinue to handle exceptions.

Log errors for debugging and monitoring.



2. Gracefully Close Streams:

Use doOnCancel or doFinally to clean up resources.



3. Send Error Events:

Notify the client of specific errors using SSE event and data format.



4. Retry Mechanism:

Send retry directives for client reconnection.




On the Client Side:

1. Handle Disconnections:

Implement reconnection logic using a backoff strategy.



2. Log Errors:

Notify the user or log issues for debugging.




By combining these strategies, you can create a reliable SSE-based architecture that gracefully manages errors and ensures a seamless user experience.
